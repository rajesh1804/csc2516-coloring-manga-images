## CycleGANs & Pix2Pix

Refer to the [readme.md](cycleGAN_and_pix2pix/README.md) file in the  **cycleGAN_and_pix2pix** directory for details on how to reproduce the results.

## Instructpix2pix

Execute the **[InstructPix2Pix.ipynb](instructpix2pix/InstructPix2Pix.ipynb)** under the **instructpix2pix** directory on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by following the comments to reproduce the results.

## Metrics Generation

Run `eval.py` under the **Metrics** folder to generate SSIM and FID scores for all the models.
